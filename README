Bash script for backing up a machine using rsync to an rsync daemon, optionally
using a ssh tunnel. I use this for backing up linux servers and desktops to a
box at home running the excellent FreeNAS (http://www.freenas.org/).

Intentionally doesn't doing anything fancy with rsync and cp to create
incremental backups (a la rsnapshot), the target machine is expected to do
that, with FreeNAS this is done using ZFS snapshots.

Comments are welcome.
